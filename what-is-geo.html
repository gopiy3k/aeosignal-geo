    <h2>The Dawn of Generative AI Search</h2>
    <p>The internet is evolving. For years, businesses have focused on SEO – optimizing for traditional search engines like Google to rank high in a list of links. But the game has changed. Today, powerful generative AI platforms such as Google's AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others are redefining how users find information. They don't just provide links; they synthesize, summarize, and generate direct answers, often without a user ever clicking through to a website.</p>
    <p>This fundamental shift demands a new, proactive approach to digital visibility: Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO).</p>
    <p>At aeosignal, we understand this new frontier. Our GEO solution is your strategic compass, meticulously crafted to help your content not just rank, but to be understood, cited, and recommended by these intelligent generative AI systems.</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?</h2>
    <p>Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO) is the practice of strategically optimizing your website's content, structure, and technical foundation to enhance its visibility and influence within AI-driven search experiences. While SEO focuses on getting your website to rank in traditional search engine results pages (SERPs), GEO aims to ensure your content is the source that AI models choose when generating direct answers to user queries.</p>

    <div class="seo-geo-box">
        <h3>Think of it this way:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Helps users find your site in search results.</li>
            <li><strong>GEO:</strong> Helps AI use your content to answer user questions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>This means influencing how Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems process, interpret, and present information from your site.</p>
